            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Lords of Sonicia (which is often abbreviated to LoS) is a rock band based in Western Australia. It the culmination of years of attempts by Samuel Matthews at creating a band. 
                LoS is comprised of many members, each with their own unique musical influences, preferences, and styles, and are currently in the process of writing songs for their self-titled debut album, <i>Lords of Sonicia</i>. 
                LoS has a sound like no other modern-day band, blending the catchy, gentle guitar lines of The Smashing Pumpkins, the simple, often noisy, but beautiful melodies of Foo Fighters, and the indie charm of 
                Ricky Jamaraz, with the raucous, careless noise walls of Nirvana- at least according to Samuel.
