    <p class="s1">High-priority content that should be here until the page is finished</p>
    <p class="p1">I have not yet contributed anything to the F/A-18 Hornet project, but there are many very skilled developers that have. I do not lead the project, nor have I contributed anything as of yet, so if you're here because you're looking for the person who created the project, I recommend checking out <href="https://github.com/SammySkycrafts">SammySkycrafts</href>. He's the guy in charge of the project, and his work on not only the Hornet, but also heaps of other projects, is just incredible. Of course, there are heaps of other people shedding blood. sweat, and tears (not literally, I hope) over this project, but that list would go on for ages and ages, so I think it's best to just credit them all in one go like this.</p>
    <p class="p1">However, when I do finally get around to contributing something to this project, I'll update this page to include it as soon as possible, so stay tuned :)</p>
