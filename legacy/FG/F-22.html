    <p class="s1">High-priority content that should be here until the page is finished</p>
    <p class="p1">The details of the F-22 Raptor model for FlightGear is kind of blurry, since not a lot of work on the project has been done in at least a decade, and the amount of repositories and unfinished models that exist are so many and so far distributed, many of which share a lot of common assets but credit completely different developers. However, I am doing my best to find the original contributors to the version that I am basing my version upon, and if/when I do find them, I will make sure to credit them.</p>
    <p class="p1">I should probably also mention how terrible the aircraft's assets and FDM currently are, but obviously there is a lot of factors about the Raptor's flight characteristics and systems that are classified, so chances are that there'll be quite a few numbers and assets taken from other aircraft, such as the F-15, F-16, and maybe even the F-14- provided the developers of the assets I want to use from them are okay with me doing so.</p>
