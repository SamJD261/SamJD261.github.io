        <h1 class="h1">About</h1>

        <p class="p1">
            I have been writing code since either 2020 or 2021 (there was a pandemic, give me a break). Either way, a classmate of mine convinced me to pick up Python, and I did. 
            And I don't regret a thing, Python's great! Some time later, I decided to try C#. I didn't understand it at first, but a few months later I started trying it again and seemed to understand the basics okay. 
            I don't exactly remember how long I've been doing HTML/CSS for, but I must admit I find the language very easy to understand. I believe that anyone can become a developer, and you don't need to be a 
            low-level programming genius to have some fun creating a program. Because I'm certainly no programming expert; in fact I'm still very much an amateur. Once I started developing in C# 
            (which I admittedly don't do much of), I immediately realised how simple these programs made it to pull a prank on friends (and teachers). 
            It didn't take much to create a C# app that opened an unlimited number of tabs at once, playing Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up", or some other random website. 
            It certainly didn't take much to make a semi-convincing "educational" webpage that was actually also just a rickroll.
