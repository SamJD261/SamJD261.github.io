                Advance on Crawley was a shoegaze and punk band from Western Australia. The band was originally a trio, with Sam Matthews on guitar, Maika Gauden on bass 
                and vocals, and Odie Rose on drums. Maika and Odie left Advance on Crawley shortly after the release of <i>something to you EP</i>, shortly after 
                which Ross Mitchell joined as a second guitarist- initially, Ross was meant to join before the EP was recorded, but was unable to. Ross and Sam were the
                only constant members of Advance on Crawley in its final few months, though a number of drummers and bassists came and went. Early in July 2025, 
                Advance on Crawley officially disbanded, as Sam and Ross started focusing more on newer projects.
